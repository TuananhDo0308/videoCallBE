## Description

The **Real-Time Meeting Platform** is a web-based application designed for seamless online communication through text chat and video calls. Built with modern web technologies, it leverages **WebSocket** for low-latency messaging and **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer video and audio streaming. The platform enables users to join chat rooms, send instant messages, and participate in video calls with real-time interaction, making it ideal for virtual meetings, collaborative discussions, and social gatherings.

This project was developed by a team of five students as part of a university assignment for the **Web Technology** course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Education. The frontend was primarily handled by ƒê·ªó Tr·∫ßn Tu·∫•n Anh, focusing on a responsive and animated user interface.

Key features include:
- **Real-Time Chat**: Instant messaging in chat rooms using WebSocket for low-latency communication.
- **Video Calls**: Peer-to-peer video and audio calls with WebRTC, including camera and microphone controls.
- **Secure Authentication**: User login and registration with Spring Security.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktops and mobile devices with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion animations.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports multiple concurrent users with a robust Spring Boot backend.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the **Real-Time Meeting Platform** locally.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
- **Java**: JDK 17 or higher.
- **Gradle**: For building the Spring Boot backend.
- **MySQL**: Version 8.x or higher for the database.
- **Git**: For cloning the repositories.
- **STUN/TURN Servers**: For WebRTC video call support (e.g., Google STUN servers).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repositories**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TuananhDo0308/meeting-frontend.git
   git clone https://github.com/TuananhDo0308/meeting-backend.git
   cd meeting-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**:

   Navigate to the backend repository:

   ```bash
   cd ../meeting-backend
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:

   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `meeting_db`).
   - Update the backend configuration file (`application.properties`) with your database credentials:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/meeting_db
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

5. **Configure WebSocket and WebRTC**:

   - Ensure the backend WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) is accessible.
   - Use Google STUN servers for WebRTC or set up custom STUN/TURN servers in the frontend configuration:

     ```javascript
     const iceServers = [
       { urls: "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302" },
       // Add TURN servers if needed
     ];
     ```

---

## Configuration

1. **Frontend Configuration**:

   - Update the API base URL in the frontend to point to your backend:

     ```javascript
     // src/config/api.js
     export const apiLinks = "http://localhost:8080";
     ```

2. **Backend Configuration**:

   - Configure WebSocket in `application.properties`:

     ```properties
     spring.websocket.stomp.endpoint=/ws
     spring.websocket.stomp.allowed-origins=*
     ```

   - Set up Spring Security for WebSocket authentication (e.g., username/password or JWT).

3. **Environment Variables**:

   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in `.env.local` (frontend) and `application.properties` (backend).

---

## Running the Project

### Local Development

1. **Start the Backend**:

   ```bash
   cd meeting-backend
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

   The backend will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Start the Frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd meeting-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Access the Application**:

   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
   - Register or log in to access the platform.
   - Join chat rooms, send messages, or start video calls.

### Production

1. **Build the Frontend**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Deploy the Backend**:

   - Package the Spring Boot application:

     ```bash
     ./gradlew build
     java -jar build/libs/meeting-backend.jar
     ```

   - Deploy to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and configure a production database.

3. **Set Up a Domain**:

   - Purchase a domain and configure DNS to point to your server.
   - Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle WebSocket connections.
